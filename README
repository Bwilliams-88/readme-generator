# My README.md Generator

## For this assignment I was tasked with creating a README generator while using a prompt of questions through the command line. I found this to be one of the more simple assignments in this course so far, I really enjoyed this assignment and didn't feel super stressed while working on it like I did with the weather app assignments and a few other previous assignments.
