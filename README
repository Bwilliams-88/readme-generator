# My README.md Generator

## For this assignment I was tasked with creating a README generator while using JavaScript to make a prompt of questions to answer through the command line that will generate a README.md file. I found this to be one of the more simple assignments in this course so far, I really enjoyed this assignment and didn't feel super stressed while working on it like I did with the weather app assignments and a few other previous assignments.
